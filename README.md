# Interface Documentation

## Introduction
This project aims to create an interactive schematic drawing canvas to replace the canvas used in Issie, an open-source digital circuit design and simulation developed by Tom Clarke. The project is split into three key modules: Symbol, BusWire, and Sheets - each implementing a distinct functionality. Each module is briefly described in the sections below, with their interfaces detailed in their corresponding markdown files.
